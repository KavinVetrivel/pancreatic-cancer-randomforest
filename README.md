# Pancreatic Cancer Detection Using RandomForest

## Overview
This project aims to detect pancreatic cancer using machine learning techniques, specifically the RandomForest algorithm. The model is trained and evaluated on urinary biomarker data to distinguish between healthy individuals, benign conditions, and pancreatic cancer cases.

## Dataset
The primary dataset used is `urinary_biomarkers.csv`, which contains urinary biomarker measurements and clinical information for multiple patient cohorts. Key columns include:
- `sample_id`: Unique identifier for each sample
- `patient_cohort`: Cohort group (e.g., Cohort1, Cohort2)
- `sample_origin`: Sample collection site
- `age`, `sex`: Demographic information
- `diagnosis`: Diagnosis code (e.g., 1 for healthy/benign, 2 for benign conditions, 3 for pancreatic cancer)
- `stage`: Cancer stage (if applicable)
- Biomarker columns: `plasma_CA19_9`, `creatinine`, `LYVE1`, `REG1B`, `TFF1`, `REG1A`, etc.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., sex, cohort).
   - Normalize or standardize biomarker values as needed.
2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Select relevant biomarkers and clinical features for model input.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Use the RandomForest classifier from scikit-learn.
   - Split the data into training and test sets.
   - Train the model on the training set.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
   - Analyze feature importance to interpret which biomarkers contribute most to the prediction.

## Usage
1. **Requirements**:
   - Python 3.x
   - pandas
   - scikit-learn
   - numpy
   - matplotlib (for visualization)

2. **Running the Project**:
   - Open the Jupyter notebook (e.g., "PancreaticCancerDetectionUsingRandomForest").
   - Follow the cells to preprocess data, train the RandomForest model, and evaluate results.
   - Modify the code as needed to experiment with different features or model parameters.

3. **Example**:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('urinary_biomarkers.csv')
# Preprocess and select features...
# X, y = ...
# X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
# clf = RandomForestClassifier()
# clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
# y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
# print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

## Results
- Summarize your best model's performance here (e.g., accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix).
- Discuss which biomarkers were most important for detection.
